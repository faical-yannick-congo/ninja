# ninja
A python server designed to securely share code execution and data access. It sets a form of execution license and data access policy between a researcher that is willing to share an instance of his code or a copy of his data but does not allow distribution of the underneath code or data. This server tries its best to hidden the code and data provided. One will submit a code and an execution recipe that will be run on a hidden data or submit a well structured data that will be used by the hidden code instance. The result is the output of either the code execution on the hidden data or the hidden code instance on the provided data. Ninja serves as a proposal to bring reproducibility sceptics refusing to allow distribution of their codes or data but are willing to share an instance or access that prohibit distribution until the owner allows it.
